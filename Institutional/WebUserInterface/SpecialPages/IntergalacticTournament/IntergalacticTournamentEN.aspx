    <p>
        Up to 1.000 players will compete to win Orion's Belt First Intergalactic Tournament, but only the very best ten will reach the final phase.
    </p>
    <p>    
        At this time the tournament is already opened for enrollment. Once you've registered you will be grouped with other players and on the 
        <strong style="font-size:14px;text-decoration:underline;">15th of January</strong> the tournament will officially start. 
        Until then, you may practice for the tournament by playing Orion's Belt regular games.
    </p>
    <p>
        The tournament is composed of two qualifying rounds and a final. In the first qualifying round there will be one hundred groups 
        (with ten players per group) and the second round will involve only ten groups (also with ten players per group).
        In each group, players will battle each other for points. Only the best player in each group will advance to the next phase.
    </p>
    <p>
        The final phase will be composed of a single group, with the ten best players of the tournament. The supreme winner of Orion's Belt First 
        Intergalactic Tournament will be the one that plays better in the nine matches that compose the final round of the tournament. 
        Orion's Belt matches produce a score based on the combat units that you destroy. The more you destroy, the higher score you'll get. 
        Even if you're going to loose a specific battle, you should try to get the best possible score on that battle because all points will 
        count for the final classification.
