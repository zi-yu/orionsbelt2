In your zone are five <a href='/en/Universe/Planets.aspx'>Planets</a> you can <a href='/en/Universe/Colonize.aspx'>Colonize</a> and build Facilities and Combat Units.  Then combine your Combat Units into a <a href='/en/Universe/Fleet.aspx'>Fleet</a> and <a href='/en/Universe/Travel.aspx'>Travel</a>
  through a local <a href='/en/Universe/WormHole.aspx'>WormHole</a> to the public <a href='/en/Universe/HotZone.aspx'>Hot Zone</a>.
