Each XML file contains tokens and associated translations
to several languages. This is the used structure:

<entry key="BoardMaster">
	<lang key="en">Board Master</lang>
	<lang key="pt">Mestre do Tabuleiro</lang>
</entry>

An entry has a key (key="BoardMaster") and the translated
text for each language. On this example we have translations
for generic english and generic portuguese.

# 
# Other Languages
#

It there's an entry without yout target language, you can create it:

<lang key="fr">...</lang>	# French
<lang key="de">...</lang>	# German
<lang key="es">...</lang>	# Spanish

And so on. If you don't know the language key to use, contact us.

# Rules
#

» Please don't use the " character

» If you spot on a translation something between brackets, you 
  can't translated it. For example: "This facility gathers [Energy]";
  [Energy] will be automatically replaced by the content of the
  "Energy" entry.
  
» You may find something like: "{0}" on the localizations. That means
  that a variable will be inserted on that location, you shoul keep
  those tokens on your translation at a suitable place. If you don't
  understand what's going to be replaced, contact us.
  
» Please save the files using UTF8 enconding.
